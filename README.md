# Virtual Background

All work shown here is my implementation of what Ben the Elder showed [here](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/). All credit goes to him !

# Dependencies

In order for this to work, you'll need python (and all dependencies from requirement.txt), and v4l2loopback-dkms (for Ubuntu systems)

# To start the thing

1. Build the Bodypix container
2. Start a bodypix container
3. Create the virtual webcam
4. Start fake.py

Have fun !
